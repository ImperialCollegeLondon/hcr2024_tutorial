## Tutorial
The purpose of this tutorial is to give you some hands-on practice. There are 3 main parts:
 1) 10 minutes presentation of the main concepts.
 2) Controlling a P3AT in simulation, by learning to use ROS, Docker, Makefiles and Gazebo.
 3) Controlling the real robot, for which you'll need to connect over SSH to the robot's laptop, set up your VNC server, and manage a multi-machine ROS network.

### Setting up your environment
 1) Make sure your computer has `git` installed, and clone this repo using `git clone XXX`.
